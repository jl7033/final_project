<div id="motivation" class="section level1">
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>MLB player salaries are growing faster than ever. In 2001, former
Seattle Mariners superstar Alex Rodriguez signed a 10-year, $252 million
deal that broke the record for the most lucrative contract in
professional sports history. And yet, Rodriguez’s deal pales in
comparison to the monster contract that current superstar Juan Soto is
expected to sign within the next week, which is projected to go for at
least 12 years and $600 million. The skyrocketing salaries don’t just
apply to the game’s most marquee names; since 2003, the average player
salary has more than doubled, from $2.37 million to $4.98 million for
the 2024 season (<a
href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/236213/mean-salaray-of-players-in-majpr-league-baseball/">source</a>).
As players become more and more expensive and teams face increasingly
harsh luxury tax penalties for exceeding certain payroll thresholds, MLB
teams face important decisions on which, if any, free agents to sign to
long-term, expensive contracts.</p>
<p>The primary goal of our project is to determine whether baseball
players – both batters and pitchers – are worth their salaries, and
whether teams should focus primarily on signing big-money free agents or
taking a more egalitarian and young player-heavy approach. More
specifically, are advanced statistics such as OPS+ (for hitters) and
ERA+ (for pitchers) significantly associated with player salary? Our
conclusions could give MLB teams insight into how they can build their
rosters to optimize their chances of making the postseason and
ultimately winning the World Series.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level1">
<h1>Related work</h1>
<p>There has been a heated debate over the use of statistics and
analytics in the evaluation of player performances and whether the
decision to pay players can be aided by these methods. <a
href="https://sabr.org/sabermetrics">Sabermetrics</a> is one of the more
popular ways of applying statistics to baseball to be an addition to
traditional evaluations. The famous movie <a
href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/">Moneyball</a> tells the
story of the Oakland Athletic’s, an underdog using statistics over
traditional evaluations to gain an edge. One of the hopes of our project
is to approach some of these same problems from our own perspective.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level1">
<h1>Initial questions</h1>
<p>Before beginning the project, we set out to potentially answer three
primary questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What collected statistics are most correlated with salary? Are
advanced statistics such as ERA closer than simple counts such as
strikeouts?</p></li>
<li><p>Are GMs good at deciding who to give contracts? That is, do the
players with the highest salaries have the best performance
metrics?</p></li>
<li><p>Can we predict the salary of a player with a model built from
their 2022 statistics?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>After conducting an exploratory data analysis, we adjusted our
questions into:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Can we construct a model from both counting and advanced
statistics that predicts the salary of a baseball player?</p></li>
<li><p>What player is on the ‘best’ contract? That is, who is the best
player in the MLB in terms outperforming their contract? What player is
on the ‘worst’ contract?</p></li>
</ol>
</div>

<h3>Salary Data</h3>
<p>The salaries data is cleaned and processed by renaming columns for
clarity (e.g., position, salary_2022, service_time_yrs, name). The name
column is split, reversed, and rejoined to standardize the name format,
handling “Jr” formatting and removing special characters. Non-ASCII
characters are converted to Latin equivalents using
stri_trans_general(). The primary position is extracted from the
position column, and the positions are reordered using fct_relevel() to
create a new simple_position column. Additionally, a service_time_floor
column is created by rounding service_time_yrs to the nearest whole
number using floor(). The final dataset contains cleaned player names,
positions, salary information, and service time.</p>

<h1>Exploratory analysis</h1>
<p>Our exploratory data analysis can be grouped into three categories:
salary, batting, and pitching.</p>
<div id="salary-eda" class="section level3">
<h3>Salary EDA</h3>
<p>Player salaries were highly right-skewed. This was expected, as many
players make the league minimum salary of 700,000. The one position
group not so heavily right skewed are the Designated Hitters. Similarly,
the Designated Hitters had a higher average years of experience.
Intuitively this makes sense as teams will want to select the better
players for the position. Overall, most players were in their first year
of the MLB with 68.2% having 5 or less years of experience. Players with
more years of experience seem to get higher salaries, increasing as
their years of experience.</p>

<h3>Batting EDA</h3>
<p>Many of the counting statistics for batting are right skewed, as most
players are not hitting multiple home runs in the season. Some of the
advanced statistics such as OPS+ are more normally distributed. An
important idea to keep in mind is that many of these collected
statistics are strongly correlated with each other as the advanced
statistics are often a formula taking input from the counting
statistics. Looking at the relation with salary, it seems that there may
be an association between salary and home runs as well as OPS+.</p>

right-skewed, and decided to use <span
class="math inline">\(log_{10}\)</span> instead of <span
class="math inline">\(ln\)</span> for the sake of interpretability. We
included ERA+, the measure of a pitcher’s ERA relative to the league
average, as well as innings pitched (<code>ip_total</code>), walks per
nine innings (<code>bb9</code>) and strikeouts per nine innings
(<code>so9</code>); we used walks/strikeouts per nine innings since the
total number of walks/strikeouts would be highly correlated with the
number of innings pitched.</p>
<p>We accounted for pitcher handedness (right vs. left) as well as
pitcher type (the default type is a closing pitcher, with relief
pitchers and starting pitchers also included in the model). Finally, we
explored the interaction between handedness and pitcher type to see if
pitcher type affects the relationship between handedness and salary.</p>
<p>From our model, we can see that pitcher handedness and pitcher type
have no significant effect on expected salary. Interestingly, the
<code>era_2</code> predictor, even when accounting for pitcher
handedness, pitcher type, and the number of innings pitched, has an
insignificant <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>-value, implying
that there is no significant association between one of the most highly
regarded summative statistics for pitching effectiveness and pitcher
salary when accounting for pitcher handedness, pitcher type, innings
pitched, walk and strikeout rates, and service time.</p>
<p>The residuals vs. fitted values plot shows that the residuals are
generally evenly spread out; the straight line on the left side of the
plot represents the large number of MLB players who are still on their
rookie contracts, and therefore have a low fitted value (as they usually
make between $700,000 and $1,000,000 per year, which is quite low by MLB
standards). The Normal Q-Q plot shows that the model’s residuals deviate
only slightly from Normal behavior.</p>

is played and the way in which front offices choose which players to
sign and how to maximize their talent. As a consequence of this
revolution, MLB teams have deemphasized simpler statistics once thought
of as key indicators of performance – such as batting average for
hitters and wins for pitchers – in favor of more complex ones, such as
OPS+ and ERA+, that more thoroughly encapsulate a player’s value to
their team.</p>
<p>We sought to use these advanced statistics in order to explore
whether players with top salaries are truly earning them. We found that
while OPS+ had a significant positive association with salary for
hitters, ERA+ had no significant association with salary for pitchers,
implying that other indicators – specifically service time, innings
pitched, walk rate, and strikeout rate – were stronger predictors of a
player’s salary. The team-building implications of these results are
fascinating, especially with respect to pitchers. If there is little to
no association between a pitcher’s ability to limit runs and their
salary, which kinds of pitchers should teams sign in order to maximize
the value of their contracts?</p>
<p>Our pitching model was more sophisticated than our batting model for
two main reasons: first, there was more available data on pitcher
handedness and pitcher type that we felt was necessary to adjust for in
the model, and second, a pitching model based only on ERA+ and service
time did not properly satisfy the assumptions of linear regression
(namely, the fitted values had a sharply bimodal, non-Normal
distrbution). In addition, we first tried treating service time as a
quantitative variable, but we found that our models overvalued veteran
players to the point where their predicted salaries were high regardless
of their underlying statistics. Therefore, we created a binary
<code>experience_group</code> variable, which separated players who were
on their rookie contracts (i.e. 0-2 years of experience) from players
who had reached salary arbitration (i.e. 3+ years of experience).</p>
<p>The top five batters and top five pitchers, by salary below expected,
came from similar demographics: veterans on cheap deals. Interestingly,
only two of the top five batters and one of the top five pitchers had an
above-average OPS+ and ERA+, respectively. However, this doesn’t mean
that these players didn’t carry a good deal of value for their teams, as
even a league-average player on a far below-average salary gives teams
more payroll flexibility without sacrificing too much production. The
implications for team-building based on these results are clear: instead
of spending large amounts on a select few players, give deals to
veterans who may be undervalued by the market, as they are more likely
to produce value than the most expensive players. The Tampa Bay Rays, a
team known for their reluctance to spend as much as their success, have
utilized this strategy quite well, riding a combination of young players
on rookie contracts and veterans let go by other teams – such as Yandy
Diaz, Manuel Margot, Ji-Man Choi, Corey Kluber, and Jeffrey Springs – to
the fifth-highest winning percentage in MLB (out of 30 teams) over the
last 10 seasons.</p>
<p>So, what does this mean for the players who earn top-dollar
contracts? Eight of the top 10 batters and eight of the top 10 pitchers
by salary recorded an OPS+ or ERA+ above 110, meaning that the hitters
and pitchers were well above average at creating runs and recording
outs, respectively. And yet, none of them, (even Mike Trout, a perennial
MVP candidate, and Justin Verlander, who won the AL Cy Young Award as
the AL’s top pitcher in 2022) had an expected salary that was higher
than their actual salary. In fact, despite recording an excellent 169
ERA+, three-time Cy Young winner Max Scherzer was ranked among the top
five <em>least</em> cost-effective pitchers in the league by our model.
The primary reason: at $43.3 million, he was the highest-compensated
hitter or pitcher in the entire league. Even though most of the top-paid
MLB players enjoyed good if not great seasons, their performance was
still not quite strong enough to justify their salaries.</p>
