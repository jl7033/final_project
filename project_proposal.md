# Tentative project title

Who is worth their salary? Analyzing MLB players’ production relative to
their annual income.

# Motivation for this project

Many Major League Baseball players make a lot of money, and the sport is
rich in data metrics. We want to understand the relationship between
hitter quality based on various metrics, and how that relates to player
salary.

# Intended final products

- Report

- EDA

- Basic statistical analysis

- Regression analysis

- Website

- screencast

# Anticipated data sources

## 2022 MLB player stats (from Kaggle)

# Planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

## Coding challenges:

- Merging the two datasets

- Checking data quality (players with few at bats, those listed for
  multiple teams)

## Planned analyses:

- Analysis of different metrics for hitting quality (HRs, RBI, batting
  avg, OPS+)
- Comparison of salaries across teams
- Comparison of hitters vs. Right and Left hand pitchers

## Visualizations:

- Distribution of Salary and OPS+/ERA+ by Team / League
- Scatterplot of OPS+ (an all-encompassing hitting metric) or ERA+ (an
  all-encompassing pitching metric) vs. salary
